# Call Flows

A **call flow** is the step-by-step path an incoming call follows when it reaches your business. Instead of ringing one phone and hoping someone answers, a call flow ensures every call is handled consistently — whether by routing to the right team, playing an automated message, or capturing a voicemail.

Call flows are important because they:

- Reduce missed calls by routing customers to the right person faster.
- Create a streamlined calling experience with greetings and menu options.
- Save time for your team with automations, like voicemail-to-text or SMS follow-ups.
- Ensure 24/7 coverage with rules, forwarding, or AI Agent assistance.

With SalesCaptain’s drag-and-drop builder, you can customize call flows to match your exact business needs.

## Getting Started

There are **four **primary elements to the call flow builder that are essential to know about if you want to set up the perfect call flow for your business.

1. **Canvas: **

   The primary workspace where you arrange elements in order to direct your incoming calls to the right places. 

   Use the controls on the left corner to zoom in, zoom out, view your entire call flow at once, and toggle interactivity of elements.
2. **Call Flow Elements: **

   The available elements you can implement within your call flow to trigger certain actions; such as playing an audio message, implementing a time rule, or directing the call to a particular user or team.
3. **Connecting Lines: **

   The dotted lines that indicate which elements are connected and what actions will be triggered next.

   The flow is organized from top to bottom, beginning with the incoming call, and the call flow can have as many or as few elements as you would like.
