### <u>How calls are routed</u>

When someone dials your SalesCaptain number, you can set calls to:

- Ring you directly.
- Notify a group of teammates.
- Be answered by an AI phone agent.
- Go to voicemail if no one is available.

### <u>Answering calls</u>

Calls ring simultaneously on all your connected devices:

- Desktop app
- Mobile app (iOS & Android)
- Web browser

To answer, simply tap the incoming call notification

### <u>Call controls</u>

During a live call, you can:

- Place the call on **hold**.
- **<u>Transfer</u>**<u> </u>to another teammate or team.
- Add someone else with **<u>conference calling</u>**<u>.</u>
- **<u>Record</u>** the call or **<u>take notes</u>** in real time.

### <u>If you miss a call</u>

If your team is unavailable or outside business hours, SalesCaptain ensures customers are still taken care of:

- **<u>After-hours routing</u>**<u> </u>to voicemail, AI agents, or another number.
- **<u>Voicemail-to-text</u>** so you can quickly review missed messages.
- **<u>Scheduled callbacks</u>** automatically created for follow-up.
- **<u>AI phone agent</u>** available 24/7 to answer questions or take bookings.

Youâ€™ll receive instant notifications so you can follow up quickly.
